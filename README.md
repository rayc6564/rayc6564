Hello, I'm Raymond, this is just a place to put all my projects in. I'm not like all the other programmers. My passion for CS/programming started in my senior year of high school. 
My school offered AP Principles of Computer Science, and I decided to take it and try it out. I learned Python there and during the last couple of months of high school, I decided what I wanted to do

Now I'm in college at KSU for one year, then transferring to GT. I hope to get an internship during my time as a student and when I'm done, I will have a job. 

I'm quite passionate about this dream and I will always pursue this.
