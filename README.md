Hello, I'm Raymond. I'm not like all the other young programmers (proteges). My passion for CS/programming started in my senior year of high school. 
My school offered AP Principles of Computer Science, and I decided to take it and try it out. I learned Python there and during the last couple of months of high school, I decided what I wanted to do

Now I'm in college at Georgia Institution of Technology right now, and I hope to get an internship during my time as a student and when I'm done, hopefully have a job in some field related to Cybersecurity

I enjoy making website in my free times using Vite React and Express, I also enjoy working with other programmers as it let me know what I'm still lacking and what I am already good at

I'm quite passionate about this dream and I will always pursue this.
